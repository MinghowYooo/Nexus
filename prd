#### **3.2. Functional Requirements (MVP)**

**Feature: Agentic Discovery**
*   The agent must accept natural language text input from the user.
*   The system will use an LLM API (e.g., GPT-4o) to interpret user intent.
*   The agent will respond with a clarifying question or immediately begin populating the main feed with videos matching the query.
*   The agent must maintain conversation context within a single session.

**Feature: Intelligent Comments Hub**
*   For any video, the creator can navigate to their dashboard and click a "Summarize Comments" button.
*   The system will send all text comments for that video to an LLM API with a prompt to extract key themes, common questions, and overall sentiment.
*   The output will be a concise, bulleted list displayed to the creator.

**Feature: Video & Profile**
*   Standard video upload functionality (supporting .mp4, up to 100MB).
*   User account creation (email/password and Google OAuth).
*   Ability to follow/unfollow creators.

#### **3.3. Out of Scope for MVP**
*   **NO** voice commands for the agent.
*   **NO** proactive agent suggestions.
*   **NO** live streaming.
*   **NO** advanced creator monetization (tipping, subscriptions).
*   **NO** direct messaging between users.

### **5. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)**

*   **V1.1:** Introduce voice interaction with the agent for a hands-free experience.
*   **V1.2:** Develop proactive suggestions, where the agent suggests new learning paths based on viewing history.
*   **V2.0:** Expand the creator co-pilot to include drafting replies and identifying "superfans."
*   **V2.1:** Introduce creator monetization tools, leveraging the agent to facilitate connections between creators and their most engaged fans.
